While importing Kenney assets and building a level I noticed that all three engines felt pretty friendly once I got past the first few steps. Unity Unreal and Godot all made it easy to bring assets in organize them and drop them into a scene which made level building feel familiar no matter which engine I was using. The biggest difference was how heavy each engine felt. Unity and Godot were quick to open and easy to experiment in while Unreal felt more intense and required more setup before everything worked the way I wanted especially with lighting and materials.

Instancing felt very similar across all three engines because the main idea is the same create something once and reuse it everywhere. Prefabs Blueprint Actors and PackedScenes all let you update one object and have those changes show up across the level which saved a lot of time. The difference was in how complex they felt. Unity Prefabs were the easiest to understand Godot PackedScenes felt clean and organized and Unreal Blueprints were powerful but more complicated even for simple objects.

If I had to rebuild a scene again it would be in Unreal because I found it easiest and I also found that I know how to use Unreal the best of the three. I also had issues importing but it should be figured out.
